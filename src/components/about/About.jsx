            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <h4>
              A Front-End Enthusiast and React Developer based in Lagos,

            </h4>
            <p>
              As a passionate Front-End Developer based in Lagos, Nigeria. With
              a strong love for creating elegant and interactive user
              interfaces, I'm dedicated to crafting delightful web experiences
              that leave a lasting impression.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe in the power of clean code, responsive design, and
              user-centric development. My journey began with a curiosity for
              technology, and I've honed my skills through countless hours of
              learning, coding, and experimenting.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not immersed in code, you can find me exploring new
              libraries and frameworks, sharing knowledge with the community,
              and enjoying quality time with my friends and family.
            </p>
